## 💬 About Me
I'm Valeria, a Front-End student in @Laboratoria / Bootcamp from Chile. I'm learning JavaScript, Node.js, CSS, and more - but most importantly, I'm open to learning anything!


Learning is a life long journey - it never ends. I work each day to improve my skills and become an even better web developer than the day before. Self improvement will always be present in my life, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
